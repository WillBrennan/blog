Welcome to my knowledge repository.

Throughout my career, I've had the privilege to navigate the intricate world of Applied AI/ML in Product Development. Leading teams to deliver groundbreaking products that push the boundaries of technical feasibility.  My goal with this blog is to share the lessons I've learnt - across Engineering, Research, and People Management. From the nuances of C++ and CUDA, through to the art of Project Management and Leadership. 

I hope my insights resonate with you and you have as much enjoyment reading this as I had writing it. I value constructive feedback and dialogue, so please don't hesitate to reach out with questions or comments.

I cherish the moments when I can disconnect and immerse myself in nature. Pictured above is a snapshot from Snowdonia, captured during a memorable hiking weekend. It stands as a testament to the serendipity of nature especially after a 4-hour trek.

Should you ever wish to discuss tech or trails over a cup of coffee or at an upcoming meet-up, know that my door is always open.
