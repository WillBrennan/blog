I started this blog to share small posts of things I've learnt across my career building products using computer-vision and machine-learning. There's a mix of posts of technical and soft subjects. From C++ and hough transforms through to project planning and people management. 

I hope you enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it. Let me know if you've got any questions or feedback; feel free to reach out!

I'm always around for a catch-up over coffee or going to a new meet-up! I'm also a huge fan of the outdoors, above is a photo I took in Snowdonia on a walking weekend. Its probably the best photo I've ever taken; it took 4 hours of hiking to get there.
